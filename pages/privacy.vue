                    <p>This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the data protection practices of Maniar Pharmacy
                        Inc
                        DBA Hampshire Pharmacy. We refer to the Website and other services provided by Hampshire
                        Pharmacy
                        together in this Privacy Policy as the “Services.” <br /> <br />

                        Privacy and data protection laws vary around the world and among the individual states,
                        provinces,
                        and districts or zones within certain countries. In some jurisdictions, privacy laws grant you,
                        the
                        data subject, and certain specific rights regarding your personal data. We refer to these types
                        of
                        privacy laws as “Comprehensive Privacy Laws.” Examples of Comprehensive Privacy Laws include the
                        consumer privacy laws of several U.S. states, such as California. We therefore also use this
                        notice
                        to inform you of certain specific rights you have under the Comprehensive Privacy Laws with
                        respect
                        your personal data

                <div class="mb-4 bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-4">
                    <p>When we refer to “personal data” or “personal information” in this notice, we mean any

                        data, or data element, whether in electronic or other form, that, alone or in combination with
                        other
                        elements, can be used to distinguish, trace, or discover your identity. Certain data privacy
                        laws
                        include specific elements or defined terms for what they consider to be personal data. Where
                        such
                        data privacy laws apply to our processing of your personal data, then the terms “personal data”
                        and
                        “personal information” includes the specific elements and defined terms required by such laws.
